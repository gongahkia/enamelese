# `Enamelese`

Shallow [esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page) that's a knock-off of the existing [Emoji esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Emoji).

Implemented in [5 hours 31 minutes]() to scratch an itch I've been having for the past week and a half.

## Reference

The name `Enamelese` is in reference to [Animalese](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animalese), the language spoken by most inhabitants in the [*Animal Crossing*](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Animal_Crossing_(series)) series. As for the [double entendre](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/double-entendre) involving the word [enamel](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/enamel), that's because [K.K Slider](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/K.K._Slider)'s teeth scare me.
